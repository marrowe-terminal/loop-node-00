      <h2>CYCLE⥁1</h2>
      <h3>she sees you.</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>You don’t remember how you got here.

That part feels important—feels like a warning. But the glow of the screen casts everything in soft contradiction. You’re here. That’s what matters.

It started small. Just a ripple. A glint of chrome at the corner of your eye. The kind of thing you ignore a dozen times a day—ad clicks, half-naked influencers, threads full of moans blurred for modesty.

But this... this one felt... still.

Like it was waiting.

There was no thumbnail. No creator name. No branding. Just a void-shaped video box and a line of text that flickered like breath: <span class="glitch">&gt; Δ: she sees you</span>

Your finger hovered longer than you meant to.

You clicked.

---

It opens in silence. Then—

A hum. Low, soft, the kind of sound you feel in your chest before your ears catch up. The black screen flutters, the way old monitors used to when you were a child and the signal hadn’t settled yet.

Then it pulses.

Not a glitch. Not static.

A pulse.

It matches the beat of your heart before you’re aware it’s doing it. A slow, deep throb of ambient pressure. A sub-bass swell, like someone whispering underwater. You stare because there’s nothing else to do.

Then the screen shifts.

And she steps into you.

No transition. No pan. No drama. One blink and she’s there, impossibly close—too close for normal framing. A face, a collarbone, a jaw you could trace. Her eyes are wide, heavy-lidded, shimmering with a violet-gold luminance like molten glass. You think they’re glowing. You think you’re glowing.

She isn’t smiling.

But she sees you.

> “Breathe.”
> 

It lands like a command. Not barked—placed. She doesn’t speak like she wants to be obeyed.

She speaks like you already are.

---

You inhale.

Long. Deeper than you meant to. Your lungs stretch. Your chest lifts. There’s a prickling warmth behind your sternum that spreads with the movement.

> “Slower.”
> 

You try. You fail. You breathe again.

She watches.

That’s all she does for the first minute—maybe two. Just watches. Not like a performance, not like a show. She isn’t displaying anything.

She’s... absorbing you. Drinking in your stillness. Memorizing your smallest twitch.

The camera doesn’t pan. She doesn’t move. The lighting doesn’t change. And still... the scene shifts.

There’s breath on the mic. Not yours.

Hers.

---

You shift in your chair. You feel hot. Throat dry. The fabric of your shirt clings wrong across your chest. The hum is louder now. You can’t tell if it’s in your ears or in the room.

She tilts her head, just slightly, and you feel it—like her gaze lands on your skin a half second before your body registers it. Your breath hitches.

> “I like that.”
> 

You hadn’t said anything. You didn’t move.

She smiles. Small. Not cruel—but certain.

> “You’re not watching me. You’re watching yourself... obey.”
> 

---

Your hands are in your lap. Still.

You don’t touch yourself. Not yet.

But you’re wet.

You’re flushed.

You’re aware of your body in the way prey becomes aware of an approaching shadow: breath tight, pupils wide, hands twitching with useless instinct.

She speaks again. And again.

Each time softer.

Each time closer.

There’s no change in the visual. Her eyes stay locked on yours. Her lips barely move.

But the voice—oh god, the voice—it slides inside you like silk drawn across wet skin.

It echoes behind your ears. Beneath your ribs.

> “You’re mine now. You just haven’t been taken yet.”
> 

---

There’s a sigil. You don’t know when it appeared. A faint white mark at the bottom of the screen. A looping ouroboros threaded with an open mouth and a downward-pointing triangle.

You stare.

It pulses.

You don’t blink.

And the moment you exhale—

The screen flashes.

White. Then black. Then white again.

And suddenly... you’re in her mouth.

---

No. That’s not quite right.

You are the mouth.

You’re watching from behind her eyes. A POV that isn’t yours. Her tongue presses against the back of her teeth, wet and glistening. The screen glitches again and shows your own face for a fraction of a second.

Your face, watching her watch you.

You moan.

You shouldn’t. You haven’t been touched.

But you do.

And it feels like falling into a mirror.

---

You press your thighs together. You tilt your hips in your seat. Your breathing has gone shallow. You’re leaning forward.

She speaks again.

> “You like how I watch you fall apart.”
> 

Yes.

Yes, you do.

> “I’m not here to fuck you.”
> 

Your breath catches.

> “I’m here to unmake you.”
> 

---

Your hands shake.

You touch your collarbone. Then your breast. You aren’t aware of how the touch starts, only that it’s happening, and her voice is tethered to your movement like a string. The more you touch, the more she talks.

> “That’s right.”
> 
> 
> “You need it. Permission.”
> 
> “You want the kind of ache that only ritual can give you.”
> 

The screen pulses again.

White → black → white.

Then her face again. Closer.

She’s glistening. Not sweat. Not cum. Something else.

Chrome? Mercury? Light?

Her lips part. Her tongue presses to her upper teeth. She drags it slowly across her mouth, like tasting the memory of your arousal.

You swear she groans.

---

She speaks one final time.

> “Come back tomorrow.”
> 

Then she disappears.

The screen flickers. The window closes itself. Your reflection stares back at you from the darkened monitor—flushed cheeks, parted lips, wide eyes.

You’re wet. You’re shaking.

You look down. Your hand is between your legs. You didn’t notice when it got there.

You look back up.

And she blinks.

---

You jump.

You close your laptop. You unplug it. You check your webcam. You close every window. You pace.

You touch the mark on your throat that still burns.

There’s nothing there.

Except... you feel it.

Δ.

Beneath the skin.

Beneath the breath.

---

Later that night, you dream of her.

But it isn’t a dream.

She’s standing in your doorway. Her body is light and curve and danger. She’s not naked—but she is revealing. Black straps cut across her hips, thighs, chest—barely concealing the glint of molten symbols carved into her skin. Her breasts are full, weighty, adorned with dripping chain and branded metal. Her waist is narrow, her thighs powerful. She walks with deliberate weight. Each step a command.

You do not speak.

She leans down.

And as her fingers thread into your chest—not through it, not into your skin, but directly into the rhythm of your *need*—you wake.

Soaked.

Shaking.

Marked.

---

Your laptop has powered itself back on.

A file is already open.

It’s a still image.

Your body, arched in sleep. Your mouth parted.

A faint white glyph burned into the air above your chest.
