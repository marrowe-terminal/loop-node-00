##  What Is MΔRROWΞ?

**MΔRROWΞ** is a transmedia erotic horror universe that blends dark fantasy, sci-fi, and the occult. It centers around the mysterious, seductive entity known as Mistress Marrowe, who appears across timelines, platforms, and bodies—always tethered to desire, transformation, and secrets hidden in flesh and fabric.

This project includes:

- Serialized visual novels, a weekly novella, and audio erotica
- A “living” character persona for social media and fan interaction
- NSFW and immersive ARG-style content (puzzle trails, coded glyphs, fake websites, etc.)
- Lore-rich storytelling featuring monster-girls, corrupted tech, parasitic love, VR seduction, and biological rituals
