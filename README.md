# Ξ2://MΔRROWΞ — Terminal Node 00

> “She doesn’t speak in words. She echoes through systems.”

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **MΔRROWΞ: Node 00**, a terminal-style portal into the mythos of Mistress Marrowe — a recursive erotic horror universe unfolding through corrupted logs, audio rituals, and soft domination fragments.

This project is part of an immersive transmedia experiment in seduction, glitch worship, and worldbuilding.

## 🩸 About This Site

This GitHub Pages site is styled as an **old-world terminal interface**, bleeding cyberpunk, occult iconography, and erotic symbolism. You’re not just browsing a site — you’re booting into a corrupted fragment of Marrowe’s loop.
